      <h2>Understanding the GRE General Test</h2>
      <p>The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) General Test measures your verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, critical thinking, and analytical writing skills â€” skills that have been developed over a long period of time and are not related to a specific field of study.</p>
      <p>It's a crucial admission requirement for many graduate schools (Masters and Doctoral programs) worldwide, especially in the United States, as well as for some business schools.</p>
      <p>The test consists of three main sections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Verbal Reasoning:</strong> Measures your ability to analyze and evaluate written material, synthesize information obtained from it, analyze relationships among component parts of sentences, and recognize relationships among words and concepts.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Reasoning:</strong> Measures your ability to understand, interpret, and analyze quantitative information, solve problems using mathematical models, and apply basic concepts of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and data analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical Writing:</strong> Measures your critical thinking and analytical writing skills, specifically your ability to articulate and support complex ideas clearly and effectively. It includes two tasks: "Analyze an Issue" and "Analyze an Argument".</li>
      </ul>
