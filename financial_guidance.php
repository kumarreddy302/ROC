      <h2>Planning Your Finances for Study Abroad</h2>
      <p>A sound financial plan is a non-negotiable requirement for studying abroad. It's not just about paying tuition fees; it's about demonstrating sufficient funds for your living expenses, which is a key part of your visa application.</p>
      <p>Understanding the total cost—including tuition, accommodation, food, insurance, and travel—is the first step. We help you create a realistic budget and explore all available funding options to make your dream achievable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proof of Funds:</strong> Most countries require you to show proof that you can support yourself financially for your entire course duration (or the first year).</li>
        <li><strong>Tuition Fees vs. Living Costs:</strong> We help you break down the total cost, which can vary significantly by country and city.</li>
        <li><strong>Scholarship Opportunities:</strong> Many universities offer scholarships for international students based on merit, need, or specific criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Education Loans:</strong> We provide information on securing education loans from nationalized and private banks.</li>
      </ul>
