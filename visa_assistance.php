      <h2>Understanding the Student Visa Process</h2>
      <p>Securing a student visa is the most critical step in your study abroad journey, and it can be a complex process. Each country has its own specific set of rules, documentation requirements, and interview procedures. A minor error in your application can lead to costly delays or even a visa refusal.</p>
      <p>Our experienced team is here to demystify this process and guide you at every stage. We stay up-to-date with the latest immigration policies to ensure your application is accurate and complete.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Country-Specific Rules:</strong> Requirements for the USA (F-1), UK (Student Route), Canada (Study Permit), and Australia (Subclass 500) vary significantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Documentation:</strong> Presenting proof of funds in the correct format is a common and critical hurdle.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Forms:</strong> Meticulous completion of all online and offline forms is essential to avoid rejection.</li>
        <li><strong>Interview Preparation:</strong> Many countries require a visa interview to assess your genuine intent as a student.</li>
      </ul>
