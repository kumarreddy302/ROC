      <h2>Understanding the IELTS Test</h2>
      <p>The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is the world’s most popular high-stakes English language proficiency test for study, work, and migration. It assesses all of your English skills — reading, writing, listening, and speaking.</p>
      <p>The test is designed to reflect how you will use English in your new life abroad. It comes in two main formats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IELTS Academic:</strong> For those applying for higher education or professional registration.</li>
        <li><strong>IELTS General Training:</strong> For those migrating to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK, or applying for secondary education, training programs, and work experience in an English-speaking environment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both versions provide a valid and accurate assessment of the four language skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking.</p>
